# Day 0 - Task 0: Tool Installation Setup

## ðŸ“… Date: September 19, 2025
## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Install Yosys, Iverilog, and GTKWave

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
**What was planned:**
- Set up Ubuntu 20.04+ environment with required system specifications (6GB RAM, 50GB HDD, 4vCPU)
- Install **Yosys** (Open-source synthesis tool) from source using build dependencies
- Install **Iverilog** (Icarus Verilog simulator) via package manager
- Install **GTKWave** (Waveform viewer) for signal analysis
- Verify successful installation of all three tools
- Document the installation process and create tool snapshots for GitHub repository

## ðŸš§ Challenges
**Issues encountered and solutions:**

Luckily, I was able to install everything without any difficulties.

---

## ðŸ“š Learnings
**Key technical insights:**

### Tool Ecosystem Knowledge
- **Yosys**: Open-source synthesis tool that converts RTL to gate-level netlists
- **Iverilog**: Standards-compliant Verilog simulator for functional verification
- **GTKWave**: Essential for debugging through waveform analysis
- **Integration**: These tools form a complete open-source digital design flow

### System Administration
- **Package Management**: Effective use of `apt` for dependency resolution
- **Build Environment**: Importance of proper compiler toolchain setup
- **Environment Variables**: How tool installation affects system PATH

### RISC-V Ecosystem Context
- These tools provide the foundation for open-source RISC-V development
- Understanding the complete toolchain from RTL to silicon
- Preparation for industry-standard EDA tool integration later in the program
